There is an exit to the SMALL EASTERN CAVE, and a path to the FORGE to the north west.  There is a ledge to the north, below it, is a PATH. On it, inaccessibly high, there is a DARK PASSAGE.  Far out of reach, the ledge has CHAIN LINK hanging over the edge, the remnants of a broken bridge.GRAPPLING HOOK";
